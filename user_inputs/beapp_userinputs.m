% Description:
% The Batch Electroencephalography Automated Processing Platform (BEAPP) is a modular,
% MATLAB-based software designed to facilitate flexible batch processing 
% of baseline and event related EEG files for artifact removal and analysis. 
% BEAPP is designed for users who are comfortable using the MATLAB
% environment to run software but does not require advanced programing
% knowledge.
